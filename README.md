Rework of stock Voron Trident endstop to allow insert of magnet with vice

TLDR; 3d print endstop2.stl. ViceMagnetInsert.jpg shows how to insert it.

Hi

I bought a formbot kit which came with a hall effect xy endstop. After a day of stuffing around I simply could not get the stock endstop ([a]_y_endstop_bumper.stl) to fit the magnet. 

So I took the STL and reworked it so that the magnet fitted. I also gave the endstop a flat surface so I could use a vice to push the magent in.(ViceMagnetInsert.jpg). Also there is a hole to push it out again. The hole happens to be 2.8mm which means that it should take a 3mm thread. So an iron 3M/5mm bolt would fit nicely and hold the magnet in if it was loose. Because magnets stick to iron.
